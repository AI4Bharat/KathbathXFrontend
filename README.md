## Initial Setup

   Follow the official [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to set up Flutter in your environment.

   - For VS Code users:
     - Add the Flutter extension to your editor.
     - Configure the Flutter SDK path in the environment variables.

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Navigate to the project folder and clone the repository:  
   _(Repository URL to be added)_

3. **Configure Base URL**  
   Open `lib/services/api_services_baseUrl.dart` and update the `baseUrl` to your server's URL.

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Start the App**  
   Use the following command to start the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   - You will be prompted to select the device to run the app on.

   **Note:**

   - If testing on a physical phone:
     - Enable **Developer Options** > **USB Debugging** on your phone.
     - Allow installation via USB.
   - If using an emulator, set it up in Android Studio or Xcode.

6. **Locate APK Files**
   - **Debug APK**: After a successful build, find it at:  
     `build/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - **Release APK**: Build the release version using:
     ```bash
     flutter build apk --release
     ```
     Output: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

## .env File Setup

Create a `.env` file in the app's root directory to configure app credentials. Add the following parameters:

```env
SERVER_URL='https://your_server_url'
ACCESS_ENCODE='84724' # Replace with your access-code encoder value
BOX_ID='--' # Replace with the respective box ID
PHONE_NUMBER = '----------' //Add you business whatsapp number with instructions for sharing the app
```

## Project Structure

The app's code follows this structure:

### Main Folders

- **lib/data**: Database-related code.
- **lib/enums**: Enum values used throughout the app.
- **lib/models**: Models for assignments and checkbox status.
- **lib/providers**: Listeners for recorders, players, and checkboxes.
- **lib/screens**: Screens for navigation (microtask screens are in the `microtask` folder).
- **lib/services**: API calls and server-related functions.
- **lib/utils**: Helper functions reused across tasks.
- **lib/widgets**: Common widgets (e.g., players, recorders, cards).

### Database Structure

- **database**:
  - **dao**: Data access objects to interact with database tables.
  - **models**: Table structures.
  - **repo**: Repositories for managing JSON data.
  - **utility**: Utilities like JSON-to-object conversion.
- **manager**: Contains `karya_db`, which handles tables and DAOs.

### Assets

- All assets and metadata are stored in the `assets` folder.

**Note:** Files with the `.g.dart` extension are autogenerated. Do not edit them directly. To regenerate these files after changes, run:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build
```
